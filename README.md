# Spirelike

An implementation / interpretation of [Slay the
Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) as
a text-based game.

If you enjoy this, please support the devs and purchase the original game. This
is not intended to be a stand-alone game. It's a learning project that I'm
keeping as a public repo.

## How do I play?

At the moment, the instructions are basically:

0. Install Java
1. Clone repo
2. Open in your IDE
3. Run it.

Almost everything is still in its beginning stages so don't expect
a particularly interesting game yet.
